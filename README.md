# Cardiovascular_diseaseprediction
Machine Learning Project : KEEP IT BEATING

## Problem Statement
Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is a major global concern, responsible for substantial portion 
of cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality. Early detection of CHD is paramount for 
prompt intervention and prevention efforts.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to leverage the power of machine learning 
techniques to identify people who are at risk of developing CHD within 10 years, so 
that appropriate medical intervention processes can be promptly administered.

## Enhancements
 ● Build a voting classifier which is an ensemble of different ML models used to improve performance

 ● Leverage advanced techniques like SVM, Neural networks to improve prediction power
 
 ● Explore external data sources


Approach  

01 Data Wrangling : Understanding the dataset and cleaning the data

02 EDA : Univariate and Bivariate analysis

03 Feature Engineering : Creating variable interactions based on secondary research and EDA

04 Modelling & Validation : Training multiple models and validating them, then comparing the models to arrive at the best one

05 Recommendations : The lifestyle changes to make to reduce changes of heart disease

06 Enhancements : Ensemble the models
