Machine Learning Project : KEEP IT BEATING

## Problem Statement
Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is a major global concern, responsible for substantial portion 
of cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality. Early detection of CHD is paramount for 
prompt intervention and prevention efforts.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to leverage the power of machine learning 
techniques to identify people who are at risk of developing CHD within 10 years, so 
that appropriate medical intervention processes can be promptly administered.
